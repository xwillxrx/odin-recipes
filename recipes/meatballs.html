    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Meatballs are a classic recipe, perfect in soups, casseroles or meatball sandwiches.  I make up big batches of meatballs and freeze them, adding them to a pot of boiling soup or into a bubbling pot of  Marinara Sauce creates a homemade meal in minutes!</p>

    <p>These easy meatballs are made with beef and pork for the perfect blend of flavors.  You can use any ground meat including veal, lamb or sausage.  If your meat is very lean (like in my Turkey Meatballs) I sometimes add a little bit of extra fat like a tablespoon of olive oil or some raw chopped bacon.</p>
