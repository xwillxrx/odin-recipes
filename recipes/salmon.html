    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Have you ever made a recipe that truly surprised you?  Normally I'm not a huge salmon lover, but after one bite of this ultra tender salmon, I was absolutely in love.  I literally did a little dance in the kitchen because I finally found a way that I can enjoy salmon!</p>

    <p>We all know how nutritious salmon isâ€¦ loaded with omega 3's, high in protein and tons of vitamins, so I'm glad I can enjoy those benefits.  And now, so can you!</p>

    <p>You won't believe how such a simple recipe can pack SO much flavor.  Each bite is full of sweet and savory flavors and delicate textures.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 oz each) salmon filets</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp smoked paprika</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pat salmon dry, then season with salt, pepper, paprika and blackening seasoning (if using). Set aside. Adjust oven rack to middle position, then preheat broiler.</li>
        <li>Add butter and oil to a large, oven-safe skillet over MED-HIGH heat. Once butter is melted, add garlic, water, soy sauce, sriracha, honey and lemon juice and cook 30 seconds or so, until sauce is heated through.</li>
        <li>Add salmon, skin side down (if using salmon with skin), and cook 3 minutes. While salmon cooks, baste frequently with sauce from the pan by spooning it over the top of the salmon.</li>
        <li>Broil salmon for 5-6 minutes, basting with sauce once during the broil, until salmon is caramelized and cooked to desired doneness.</li>
        <li>Garnish with minced parsley if desired.</li>
    </ol>
